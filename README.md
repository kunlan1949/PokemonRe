## Background

`Standard Readme` was originally because [@maxogden](https://github.com/maxogden) in the project [feross/standard](https://github.com/feross/standard) [This Issue](https: //github.com/feross/standard/issues/141) It is suggested whether standardizing the README will help everyone. Many people discussed this idea in the warehouse [zcei's standard-readme](https://github.com/zcei/standard-readme/issues/1). When I maintained the warehouse [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs), I needed to promote standardized Readme in this organization, so this project started from here.

> If your documentation is complete, people who use your code do not need to look at the code. This is very important. It allows you to separate interface documentation and specific implementation. It means that you can modify the implemented code while keeping the interface and documentation unchanged.

> Remember: it is the document, not the code, that defines the function of a module.

—— [Ken Williams, Perl Hackers](http://mathforum.org/ken/perl_modules.html#document)

Writing a README is not easy to some extent, and it is even more precious to maintain it all the time. If you can reduce this process, you can make it easier to write and modify the code, making it clearer whether it is necessary to change a place in the description, and you can spend less time considering whether your original document needs to be updated , You can allocate more time to write code instead of maintaining documentation.

At the same time, standardization is also beneficial in some other places. With standardization, users can spend less time searching for the information they need, and they can also build a tool to collect information from descriptions, run sample codes automatically, check authorization agreements, and so on.

The goals of this warehouse are:

1. A well-defined **specification**. The location in the warehouse is [spec.md](spec.md). It is a document that has been continuously optimized. You are welcome to raise an Issue to discuss the changes.
2. An **example README**. This Readme is fully compliant with Standard-readme, and there are more examples in the `example-readmes` folder.
3. A **Syntax Prompter** is used to indicate syntax errors in the Readme. Please refer to [tracking issue](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme/issues/5).
4. A **generator** used to quickly build a new README framework. Please refer to [generator-standard-readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/generator-standard-readme).
5. A badge with **mark compliance**. Please refer to [emblem](# emblem).

## Installation

This project uses [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com). Make sure you install them locally.

```sh
$ npm install --global standard-readme-spec
```

## Instructions for use

This is just a documentation package, you can print out [spec.md](spec.md) to the output window.

```sh
$ standard-readme-spec
# Prints out the standard-readme spec
```

### Builder

If you want to use the generator, please see [generator-standard-readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/generator-standard-readme).
There is a global executable file to run the generator in the package, the alias of the generator is called `standard-readme`.

## Badge
If your project follows Standard-Readme and the project is located on Github, I hope you can add this badge to your project. It can be accessed by more people and adopt Stand-README. Adding a badge is **not mandatory**.
